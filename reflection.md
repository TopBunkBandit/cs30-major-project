# Reflection

## What advice would you give yourself if you were to start the project again?
 - Make everything run on general variables, instead of making them run on specific variables and changing them later on
 - Use maps, they would help a lot with areas that are just blocks of variables
 - Make a function or use p5.collisions to check if the mosue is hovering over something and if a attack lands. That would make the code a bit cleaner
 - Don't make everything black, white and grey. Add color early cause you will forget to add color later
 - Don't use 2 diffrent rect modes and expect their calculations to be the same
 - On that note, make the players a center rect, so that hit reg is the same reguradless of what direction your facing

## Did you complete everything on the "Needs to have" list?
 - Yes, the game is playable on a single keyboard, there is a basic fighting system with the outlined minimum requirments, there are 3 seperate characters with 3 seperate specials, there is a functional health bar, and the game can be won or lost

## What was the hardest part of the project?
 - As stated in the first question, switching the variables over to a single general one was significantly more difficult then if I had decided to do that in the begining.
 - Also, should have used a calculator, my basic addition and subtraction are clearly rusty

## Were there any problems that you could not solve?
 - Yes and no. When I ran into problems that I was unable to solve no matter what I did, I would work on a diffrent route to the same end and would reach it.
