# Non-CS person:
 - Characters move too slow
 - Characters should have diffrent speeds
 - Blocking is too strong
 - Blocking has no start or end input delay

# What was changed/fixed
 - Character move speed was increased by 50%
 - Kick now goes through block when crouched

# What was left out:
 - Characters with diffrent move speed were not implemented, as it was causing a drastic gap between characters in terms of viability
 - Blocking was intended to be instant, nothing changed there


# CS 'person':
 - P1 special key sucks
 - P2 controls suck
 - Block is too strong
 - There is no sound
 - There are no combos
 - Specials are too easy to spam
 - Jack can place infinte landmines
 - Add a counter to crouch blocking
 - Give characters more health

# What was changed/fixed
 - P1 special key was moved to R
 - Jack can now only place landmines while his health is above 40%
 - Kick now passes through a crouch block
 - health was increased by 75%

# What was left out:
 - P2 controls were not changed, you still can't play this game on a school laptop
 - Block was intened to be strong
 - Ran out of time to implement combos
 - A special attack charge system was considered, but ultimatly decided against
